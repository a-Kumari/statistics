what is statistics and its types?
Statistics deals with the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data.
Statistics is widely used in various fields such as business, healthcare, economics, social sciences, and engineering to analyze real-world problems and draw meaningful conclusions.

Types of Statistics:
Descriptive Statistics
Inferential Statistics

1. Descriptive Statistics:
Descriptive statistics summarize and organize data to make it easily understandable.It involves the use of numerical and graphical methods.
Techniques of Descriptive Statistics:
1. Measures of Central Tendency:(mean, mode, median)
2. Measures of Dispersion (Variability): (Variance, Standard Deviation)
3. Graphical Representation of Data: (Bar Graphs, Histograms, Pie Charts, Box Plots)

2. Inferential Statistics:
Inferential statistics allows us to make predictions or generalizations about a larger population based on a sample of data. It is used to analyze relationships, test hypotheses, and make forecasts.
Techniques of Inferential Statistics:
1. Hypothesis Testing 
2. Z- test
3. chi-square test
4. Anova test or F-test

what is population and sample and sampling techniques?
Population
A population refers to the entire group of individuals, objects, or events that share a common characteristic and are the subject of a statistical study.
Example:
All students in a university.
All patients in a hospital.

Sample
A sample is a subset of the population selected for analysis.
Example:
200 students selected from a university for a survey.

Sampling Techniques
Since studying an entire population is impractical, researchers use sampling techniques to select a subset of data.

Types of Sampling:
1. Simple Random Sampling
Every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.
Example:
Selecting 100 employees randomly from a company using a lottery system.
2. Stratified Sampling
The population is divided into subgroups based on characteristics like age, gender, or income. Then, a random sample is taken from each group.

3. Systematic Sampling
A starting point is chosen randomly, and then every kth element is selected.

4. Convenience Sampling
The researcher selects individuals based on their expertise or relevance to the study.

What are Variables in Statistics?
A variable is any characteristic, number, or quantity that can change or vary across individuals or observations in a dataset. Variables are used to collect and analyze data in statistics.

Example:

Height of students (can be different for each student).
Age of employees (varies from person to person).
Number of sales in a store (changes daily).

Types of Variables

Quantitative Variables (Numerical Data) – Variables that represent numerical values.
1. Discrete Variables (Countable Data)
Variables that take specific, finite values (whole numbers).
They cannot take decimal or fractional values.

Examples:
Number of students in a class (10, 25, 30).
Number of cars in a parking lot (2, 5, 8).

2. Continuous Variables (Measurable Data)
Variables that take any value within a given range (can be decimal or fractional).
They are measured rather than counted.

Examples:
Height of students (5.4 ft, 6.1 ft).
Weight of a person (70.5 kg, 65.3 kg).
Temperature of a city (27.8°C, 30.2°C).

Qualitative Variables (Categorical Data) – Variables that represent categories or labels
1. Nominal Variables (No Order, Only Categories)
These are categories without any natural order or ranking.
Used for labeling groups.

Examples:
Gender: Male, Female, Other.
Eye Color: Brown, Blue, Green.
Blood Group: A, B, AB, O.

2. Ordinal Variables (Ordered Categories)
These are categories with a meaningful order or ranking, but the difference between them is not measurable.

Examples:
Education Level: Primary, Secondary, Higher Education.
Satisfaction Level: Very Satisfied, Satisfied, Neutral, Dissatisfied, Very Dissatisfied.
Ranking in a Competition: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.
